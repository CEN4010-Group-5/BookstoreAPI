# Common Workflow

Each feature will be its own module (file), Eg:
[BookDetails.py](https://github.com/lustered/BookstoreAPI/blob/master/components/BookDetails.py)
for the 4th feature. This will make working on each features easier to debug,
implement into the main app file
([BookstoreAPI.py](https://github.com/lustered/BookstoreAPI/blob/master/BookstoreAPI.py))
and organize each group member's work.

If any API routes with their functions need to be added, it can be done in the
[views.py](https://github.com/lustered/BookstoreAPI/blob/master/components/views.py)
file.
